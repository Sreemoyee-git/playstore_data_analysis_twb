Problem Statement:

The goal of the project was to analyze the Google Play Store app dataset and uncover valuable insights that can help in understanding the app market. The objective was to assess factors such as the average app rating, the most popular categories, the most installed apps, and the correlation between app ratings and their size. The overall aim was to identify trends and patterns that could inform decisions in app development, marketing strategies, and platform optimization.

What I Did:

1. Data Cleaning: Firstly I cleaned the data using excel.

2. Data Analysis:

Paid vs Free Apps: Analyzed the proportion of paid and free apps in the Play Store, showing that the majority of apps are free (92.62%).

Top Apps by Rating: I identified the top-rated apps such as 8 Ball Pool, Candy Crush Saga, and others, visualizing the distribution of app ratings.

Top Apps by Installs: Displayed the most installed apps like Roblox, 8 Ball Pool, and Candy Crush Saga to assess their popularity.

Category Analysis: Evaluated the distribution of apps across different categories like Games, Tools, and Communication.

App Size Grouping: Showed the relationship between app size and rating with box plots, helping understand the impact of app size on rating.

Monthly Analysis: Monitored app activity (installs and ratings) across different months, helping to observe seasonal trends.

3. Data Visualization:

Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize the metrics such as installs, ratings, app categories, and the relationship between app size and ratings.

Tools Used:

Tableau, Excel

Recommendations:

1. Focus on Popular Categories: Since categories like Games, Tools, and Productivity dominate the market, app developers should focus on these areas for higher visibility and engagement.

2. Optimize App Size: There is a notable correlation between app size and rating. Developers should focus on optimizing app size for better user experience while maintaining high performance.

3. Invest in Marketing for Free Apps: The majority of the apps are free, with a small percentage being paid. For those launching paid apps, better marketing strategies and value propositions should be developed to capture a larger audience.

Conclusion:

Through the analysis of the Google Play Store dataset, I found that most apps are free and the most installed ones are in the Games and Tools categories. App size appears to have a significant impact on ratings, which suggests that app developers should focus on optimizing app performance and size. The analysis can guide app developers, marketers, and business strategists in optimizing their approach to app development and increasing user engagement.
